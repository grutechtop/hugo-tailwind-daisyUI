# Salinger ![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

__Salinger__ is a __new-born clean-mimalistic mobile-first blazing-fast fancy__ and __lightweight__ but __powerful theme__ for [Hugo framework](https://gohugo.io).
Born as the theme for [my personal website (where you can see a demo)](http://jacksalici.com), I'd like to develop a lot of other stuffs, starting with the following feature. 
Why this name? During the development of the minimalism I was inspired by [the cover of Einaudi edition of _The Catcher in The Rye_](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=il+giovane+holden+by+j.d.+salinger+einaudi+1961&t=h_&ia=images&iax=images&iaf=color%3AWhite), by J.D. Salinger,

## Quick Start

1. Add the repository into your Hugo Project repository as a submodule: `git submodule add https://github.com/jacksalici/salinger-theme.git themes/anatole`.
2. Configure your `config.toml`. I suggest you to copy the demo `config.toml`.
