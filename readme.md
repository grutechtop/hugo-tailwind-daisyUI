# Salinger Theme 📻

![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

## Clean and minimalistic Hugo theme built with DaisyUI and Tailwind.

___Salinger___ is a _clean, minimalistic, mobile-first, blazing-fast, fancy_ and _lightweight_ theme for the [Hugo framework](https://gohugo.io).
Born as the theme for [my website (demo)](http://jacksalici.com), it has completely rebuilt using __Tailwind__ and __DaisyUI__.  
Why this name? During the design of the light mode homepage, I was inspired by [the Italian edition cover by Einaudi](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=il+giovane+holden+by+j.d.+salinger+einaudi+1961&t=h_&ia=images&iax=images&iaf=color%3AWhite) of _The Catcher in The Rye_ by J.D. Salinger.
