# Salinger ![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

Salinger is a new-born clean-mimalistic mobile-first blazing-fast fancy and lightweight but powerful theme for Hugo framework.  
Born as the theme for my personal website, I'd like to develop a lot of other stuffs, starting with the following feature. 

## Features included or to be included:
###### Checked box have already been developed.
- [ ] Dark mode
- [x] Navigation items
- [ ] Google Analytics
- [x] Multilingual
- [ ] Complete Wiki Page
- [ ] More Layouts (Masonry grid)
- [x] Toggle header option
- [ ] Custom visibility of meta
- [ ] More style palettes
- [ ] Complete example site
- [ ] Emoji support




## Preview the exampleSite

```shell
git clone https://github.com/jacksalici/salinger-theme.git salinger
cd salinger/exampleSite
hugo server --themesDir ../..
```

## Quick Start

1. Add the repository into your Hugo Project repository as a submodule: `git submodule add https://github.com/jacksalici/salinger-theme.git themes/anatole`.
2. Configure your `config.toml`. I suggest you to copy the demo `config.toml`.
3. Having installed Hugo on your local machine, you can build your site with `hugo server` and admire the result at `http://localhost:1313/`.

## Update your installation

If you want to get the latest update of the `Salinger` theme please execute this command:

```shell
git submodule update --remote --merge
```

## What about config.toml
I will soon create the wiki.
